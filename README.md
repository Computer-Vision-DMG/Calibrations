# Camera Calibration

## **!!WARNING: WORK IN PROGRESS!!**

This repository is one of the many projects I have created to showcase my knowledge of [Computer Vision](https://github.com/Computer-Vision-DMG) and [Artificial Intelligence](https://github.com/Artificial-Intelligence-DMG).

The project may appear incomplete or not yet well-formed.

I am still in the process of transferring all the necessary information from my private project to the current one, ensuring that it contains sufficient material to serve as a useful repository with educational value.

Thank you for checking out this repository! Please feel free to check back soon or contribute if you'd like to help. Your feedback is always welcome.

## Content Expected for the Calibration repository

In this repository, you will be guided through the calibration process of conventional cameras (i.e., those with a lens that converges light onto a 'light sensor,' such as a Charged-Coupled Device (CCD) or a Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS)).

**[Roadmap](## Roadmap):**

1. **[Prerequisites](###Prerequisites)**: The basic mathematical model of the cameras.
2. **[Assumptions and Topic's Target](###Assumption-and-Target)**: The estimation of the perspective projection matrix (PPM).
3. **[Theory](###Theory)**: An explanation of the mathematics that guide us through the solution of the problem, from the starting point (Prerequisites) to the target (Assumptions and Topic's Target).
4. **[Code](###Code)**: The Python implementation (and later, C++) of our solution.
5. **[Test](###Test)**: A final test to prove that the example works as expected according to our calculations.

## Roadmap
